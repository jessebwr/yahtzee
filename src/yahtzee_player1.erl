%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Scorecard Layout %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The patterns on the scorecard, and their scoring rules, are shown in the 
% following table. a and b denote distinct values shown on dice (e.g., the
% sequence a,a,a,b,b means three dice with value a and two dice with value
% b =Ì¸ a). x, y and z denote values shown on dice that may not be distinct
% (e.g., the sequence x, x, x, y, z means at least three, but possibly four
% or five, dice with value x).
